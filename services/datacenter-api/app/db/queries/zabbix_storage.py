# Zabbix Storage query definitions (Intel Storage)
#
# Zabbix storage devices and disks are DC-scoped via NetBox inventory mapping:
#   zabbix_storage_device_metrics.loki_id (varchar/text)
#   -> discovery_netbox_inventory_device.id (int8)
#
# Then disk metrics are scoped via storage device "host" values.
#
# Performance notes:
# - KPIs use latest per host/device within the requested time range.
# - Trend uses time_bucket('1 day') to downsample before UI.


# --- Storage devices for DC (latest per loki_id) ---
# Returns one row per NetBox device (loki_id), with the latest Zabbix snapshot
# within the requested time range and only when health_status IS NOT NULL.
#
# Params:
#   - dc_code: str
#   - start_ts, end_ts: timestamps

# Brocade SAN query definitions
#
# Used by DatabaseService (dc_service.py) to build DC-scoped
# Network > SAN executive views.
#
# Notes on DC scoping:
# - raw_brocade_port_status and raw_brocade_port_statistics include `switch_host`.
# - DC association for a given `switch_host` is resolved in Python via regex
#   and (fallback) NetBox discovery data.
# - raw_brocade_san_fcport_1 does NOT include `switch_host` in the current DDL;
#   bottleneck association is therefore handled in Python from `portname`.


# --- Port usage (gauges) ---

# switch_host's latest collection_timestamp.
